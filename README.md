<p>
"Crypto" is a single page react cryptocurrency application. It is a fully functional react application. User can find any kind of cryptocurrency from this site and see the Indian, American and European price pf this currency. User can graphically see the details of any cryptocurrency from this site. For the first time I use "Chakra UI" and "Framer Motion" to make this website. This website is fully responsive for every type of devices.
